DATA SET 2 
Banking Customer Churn 
 
Domain 
This data uses actual anonymized data from customer accounts for payment services and other financial services  
 
Business Scenario 
Fees and interest on deposits lent with some reserve rate are how banks make profit.  Losing customers means that the customer lifetime value is lost which will affect long term liquidity.  Understanding when customers may be ready to leave may give an opportunity to remedy scenarios that would result in lost profits 
 
Specific Questions 
Are there any contributing regional factors that seem to increase or decrease a population’s churn (based on 12 month snapshot vs full account information? 
Are there any contributing demographic factors that seem to increase or decrease a population’s churn (based on 12 month snapshot vs full account information? 
Are there any contributing account activities that seem to increase or decrease a population’s churn (based on 12 moth snapshot vs full account information? 
Are there any contributing income trend factors that seem to increase or decrease a population’s churn (based on 12 month snapshot vs full account information? 
Are there fluctuations over a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly time frame that  impact the customer churn? 
Are there any noteworthy buying or spending patterns that may trigger leaves? 


App Capstone Instructions 
Role Goals 
Help students decide which role(s) you want to pursue during the Capstone (you can change your mind) 
Simulate real-world scenarios 
External updates to management 
Enhance presentation skills 
Develop consultant skills 
Get experience in rapid prototyping  
Anticipating business needs 
Translating business needs into technical requirements 
Making tough decisions on tight deadlines  
Managing division of labor on shared responsibilities 
Procedure 
You will be divided into teams of 2 students 
Efforts will be made to balance junior and senior experiences and a diversity of role goals, but everybody is expected to do work on all  
Odd numbered cohorts may assign an individual team who has demonstrate enough self-sufficiency to accomplish goals alone 
Personal capstones are allowed for second and final presentation in addition to team capstone work and subject to instructor approval for fitness in portfolio inclusion for placement 
After the initial four hours and every four hours of instruction, alternating members of each team will provide an update to the instructor or where every team stands.  The Team Scrum Master role internal to the team and document the following: 
The status of what was accomplished since the last scrum 
Goals for the next scrum 
Any issues encountered in the past round of work that need attention 
Each team will manage their own Issues and kanban board in Azure DevOps, Microsoft Planner  or Github with an expectation that the information will match the report given. 
Checkpoint presentations of progress towards the final capstone presentation are available upon request at 50% of completion of the allotted project time with 24 hr notice 
Each team member will be expected to do an individual presentation on their work done that is their individual contribution 
All work must be checked into Github from their accounts 
The comments must make a reference to the GitHub issue associated with the task 
While collaboration is encouraged on each deck , you must be able to answer technical questions on your own in defense of your own understanding of their creation

Planning for a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) 
Your instructor will work with each team to determine the scope of the work that fits a combination of the teams’ expected capacity and role skills mastery. 
 
Business Documentation Goals 
Teams will combine the requirements gathering of being product managers/owners with being the individual contributors. Business problems and high level pain points from several stakeholders will be presented to each team.  Individuals will need to own each stakeholders’ outcomes and work together to deliver first a clear cut plan in these documents:

Technical Documentation Goals 
The depth and breadth of the App Capstone project has significantly more components and deliverables than the Dashboard Capstone.  Below is a graphic showing the ideal level of complexity for simulating a real world traditional analytics and application development project 
Teams will be expected to work together and divide tasks into individual and joint ownership after presenting proposals. Details for expected technical documentation: 
Technical Requirements Document (TRD)  
Software Architecture  
Systems Design  
Usually delivered in diagrams or bullet point outline  
Data Design  
See other Presentation Guidance  
Detailed Component Design  
Combination of diagrams and text as needed  
Analytic Architecture  
Criteria for Success  
Traditional Analytics - How many, $ etc.

Presentation Expectations  
Each student will complete a presentation communicating the findings of their capstone using PowerPoint (or something similar) along with live demos of their Power BI dashboard and SQL work. Cameras will be turned on for the presentation.  Presentations will cover the following outline:  
15 minutes (1 min pitch, 2 mins for Q&A, the 12 mins in between are up to you) 
Begin with 60-sec elevator pitch (who are you, where are you going and something memorable)
