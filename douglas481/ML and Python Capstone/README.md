## Time Series Prediction Using Facebook Prophet
# 
### Project Overview
Using Python and Facebook Prophet for predictive analysis of monthly visitor totals at Glacier National Park.

The dataset used is taken from the National Park Service at https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Visitation%20by%20Month?Park=GLAC:

### Business Scenario
I wanted to predict the seasonal variation for the park which might be used to inform when to hire seasonal workers from the NPS side or if you are a park goer it can be used to plan when would be a good time to visit the park and not run into crowds.
