## _Terraforming Star System Candidates_
# 
### Project Overview
I took publicly available data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive and wanted to find potential candidates within 100 lightyears of Earth that could be terraformed within the next few centuries, providing that the technology is developed.

### Executive Summary
I filtered all the data until I came down to 24 potential candidate priority star systems to target from a data series of over 5000 confirmed planets.
