# Team Capstone Datasets

## _Automotive Shipment Movement_
# 
### Domain 
This dataset is taken from actual ship movements captured several years ago.

In the first capstone you will receive a simplified version to orient you to the complexity of the dataset

The final dataset given in the App Capstone includes four sources:
1. Near shore captures of actual ship positions
1. Satellite captures of actual ship positions
1. Vessel information (ownership, etc.)
1. Information on port arrivals and departures
### Business Scenario
There are two big questions that machine learning can help address ultimately:
1. Port traffic forecasting is valuable business information to allow companies to make decisions on where to send goods to ensure speedy delivery.
1.  Cargo will frequently be sold and bought several times in transit.  In order to have a good understanding of the impact on ports, you will need to first understand where some ships are going and if they are changing courses
### Specific Questions
1. What are the opportunities to clean up the data?
1. Are there any natural primary and foeign keys or will we need to create and maintain them?
1. Are there any inconsistencies in the relationshps between the natural or surrogate keys?  
1. What are the measures that you will need to create to support the aggregate calculations?

## _Cancer Bioinformatics Research_
# 
### Domain 
This is data from actual bladder cancer research

### Business Scenario
One contributing factor for cancer survival rates are genetic mutations.  Understanding what mutations occur in some patients and how those mutations influence ther overall survival rate and patterns of survival rates will help identify the influence of mutations on protein pathways that pharmaceutical research can address

## _Consumer Financial Services_
# 
### Domain 
This dataset contains anonymized account information on actual consumers and their banking patterns
### Business Scenario
Consumer banks have to balance their reserve of cash that they don't lend to avoid runs on their holding on the one hand and lending it out to have that money generate interest profits.

There are two metrics that are the most important to handling the reserve side and using customer service to avoid unexpected trends in consumer behavior and manage the customers bank with some long term context:
* Churn, or likelihood of a customer to close their account
* Lifetime Value, or estimating the total fees and interest to make off the customer

## _Flight Delays_
# 
### Domain 
This data uses actual data from flight delays in the United States
### Business Scenario
Flight delays can decrease customer loyalty, have financial penalties and disrupt business.  Understanding contributing factors, root causes and trends can be useful to airline carriers to improve execution

## _Hospital Readmissions_
# 
### Domain 
This data uses actual data from a hospital in United States with actual medical history, admission and discharge information of patients 
### Business Scenario
Obamacare penalizes healthcare providers for having a higher than an adjusted average percentage of patients readmit within 30  days of discharge.  Identifying factors that influence that higher propensity will allow medical administrators to increase engagement with patients upon release to prevent patient discomfort and fines for the care providers
