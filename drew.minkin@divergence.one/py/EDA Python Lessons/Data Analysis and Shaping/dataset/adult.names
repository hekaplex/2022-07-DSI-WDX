Run MLC++ GenCVFiles to generate data,test.\n|\n| Description of fnlwgt (final weight)\n|\n| The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the\n| civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly\n| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of\n| controls.\n|  These are:\n|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.\n|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.\n|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.\n|\n| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through\n| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.\n|\n| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating\n| "weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the\n| population.\n|\n| People with similar demographic characteristics should have\n| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember\n| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is\n| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own\n| probability of selection, the statement only applies within\n| state.\n\n\n>50K, <=50K.\n\nage: continuous.\nworkclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.\nfnlwgt: continuous.\neducation: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.\neducation-num: continuous.\nmarital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.\noccupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.\nrelationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.\nrace: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.\nsex: Female, Male.\ncapital-gain: continuous.\ncapital-loss: continuous.\nhours-per-week: continuous.\nnative-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.\n'
