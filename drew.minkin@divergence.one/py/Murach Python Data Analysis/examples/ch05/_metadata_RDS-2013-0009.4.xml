      <abstract>This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.</abstract>
      <purpose>There is a wealth of information to be found in agency and local fire reports, but even the most rudimentary interagency analyses of wildfire numbers and area burned from the authoritative systems of record have been stymied to some degree by their disunity. While necessarily incomplete in some aspects, the database presented here is intended to facilitate fairly high-resolution geospatial analysis of US fire activity over the period 1992-2015, based on available information from federal, state, and local systems of record. It was originally generated to support the national, interagency Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system (https://www.forestsandrangelands.gov/FPA/index.shtml). The FPA system has since been retired, but the FPA FOD has continued to be updated periodically to support a variety of other applications and analyses.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data publication is the fourth edition of the FPA FOD, which spans 1992-2015. The first edition, which spanned 1992-2011, is available at https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2013-0009. The second edition, spanning 1992-2012, is available at https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2013-0009.2. The third edition, spanning 1992-2013, is available at https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2013-0009.3. All four editions were developed as described by Short (2014).

    <logic>The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this dataset: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, as best as possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). The records were screened for errors and redundancy. All such procedures, including the process used to identify and purge redundant records, are detailed in supporting documentation (Short, 2014).</logic>
    <complete>Viable state and local (i.e., nonfederal) records were not available from all states for all years. Estimates of wildfire numbers and area burned from the FPA FOD may therefore underrepresent actual wildfire activity in certain areas and time periods. Completeness in this regard was assessed by comparing estimates of wildfire numbers and area burned from the FPA FOD to published estimates of these metrics by state and year, and states were "scored" accordingly (i.e., low scores mean data are clearly lacking). High-scoring states include most of those in the US Great Lakes, Southeastern, and Western regions (including Alaska), as well as a handful of others. Estimates of area burned tend to be less compromised than wildfire numbers by missing nonfederal records, because very large fires tend to account for the majority of area burned and are commonly responded to and reported by multiple agencies within the fire service. Efforts to gauge the completeness of the FPA FOD are detailed in supporting documentation (Short, 2014).</complete>

        <srccontr>Interagency wildfire occurrence data from Puerto Rico, compiled by the IITF. The IITF received fire-episodes data from the Puerto Rico Fire Department (Cuerpo de Bomberos de Puerto Rico) in 2010 and in 2012. Fire episode information from the years 2008 to 2010 were received during 2010 in paper form from the PR Fire Department and the National Weather Service. The information was manually entered into an Access database using a form created specifically for the project. An Excel spreadsheet with fire episodes information from 2003 to 2011 was received in 2012 from the PR Fire Department. The data were digitally integrated into the IITF fire database in Excel. When integrating the Excel data fire episodes were carefully compared to avoid double entries since there was an overlap of years between both datasets (i.e., from 2008 to 2010).</srccontr>

        <srccontr>Federal wildfire data from the US Forest Service, as archived in the National Interagency Fire Management Integrated Database and accessed via FIRESTAT, for 1992-2015. Data accessible through FIRESTAT include both official and unofficial reports. When accessed for this compilation, only 35% of the fire reports for 1992-2015 were indicated as official (i.e., ‘approved’). Unofficial reports (which may lack approval for a variety of reasons that do not make them deficient for purposes of this compilation) were included in the FPA FOD because they represent the best available information to characterize wildfire activity associated with USFS jurisdictions.</srccontr>

        <srccontr>Records of large or otherwise significant wildfires which could not be obtained from the final fire reporting systems because they were missing or otherwise lacking the necessary information for inclusion in the FPA FOD.</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>ACQUIRING DATA:
The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. These systems include the National Interagency Fire Management Integrated Database (USFS FIRESTAT archive), the USDI Wildland Fire Management Information system, the FWS Fire Management Information System, the National Association of State Foresters database, and the National Fire Incident Reporting System. Additional data were acquired directly or indirectly from 31 US states and the territory of Puerto Rico. The ICS-209 module of the SIT209 program was used to obtain records of large fires otherwise missing from the dataset. See \Supplements\FPA_FOD_source_list.pdf (included in the full data publication download), for a list of sources and their acronyms.

DATA SELECTION:
The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this dataset: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least a precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid).

DATA PROCESSING:
Once identified, candidate records were extracted and transformed to conform, as best as possible, to the data standards (//www.nwcg.gov/data-standards) of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). The ability to conform the data to these standards was constrained by the level of adherence to those standards within the source reporting systems. 

After standardization, the data were screened for obvious errors, and compiled into a single database. A multi-step process was then used to identify and purge redundant fire records. 

More information regarding data-acquisition and processing is included in supporting documentation (Short, 2014).</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>This data publication contains a database along with a supplemental file containing source information. The database is available in 5 different formats in this publication (ACCDB, GDB, GPKG, PGD, or SQLite), which are all available as separate downloads. (Additional formats for this database will be made available in the future through another distributor soon.) Below is a description of the files and their content.

SUPPLEMENTS	  
\Supplements\FPA_FOD_source_list.pdf is an Adobe Acrobat PDF/a document containing a list of the sources of wildfire data in the FPA FOD. This information is also available in Table 1 from "A Spatial Database of Wildfires in the United States, 1992-2011" (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-6-1-2014).

This database is available as a Microsoft Access (accdb), ESRI ArcGIS geodatabase (gdb), OGC Geopackage (gpkg), PostgreSQL (pgd), or SQLite (sqlite) file. All formats contain the same two entities (Fires and NWCG_UnitIDActive_20170109) and associated attributes:

Fires: Table including wildfire data for the period of 1992-2015 compiled from US federal, state, and local reporting systems.

FOD_ID = Global unique identifier.

FPA_ID = Unique identifier that contains information necessary to track back to the original record in the source dataset.

SOURCE_SYSTEM_TYPE = Type of source database or system that the record was drawn from (federal, nonfederal, or interagency).

SOURCE_SYSTEM = Name of or other identifier for source database or system that the record was drawn from. See Table 1 in Short (2014), or \Supplements\FPA_FOD_source_list.pdf, for a list of sources and their identifier.

NWCG_REPORTING_AGENCY = Active National Wildlife Coordinating Group (NWCG) Unit Identifier for the agency preparing the fire report (BIA = Bureau of Indian Affairs, BLM = Bureau of Land Management, BOR = Bureau of Reclamation, DOD = Department of Defense, DOE = Department of Energy, FS = Forest Service, FWS = Fish and Wildlife Service, IA = Interagency Organization, NPS = National Park Service, ST/C&amp;L = State, County, or Local Organization, and TRIBE = Tribal Organization).

NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_ID = Active NWCG Unit Identifier for the unit preparing the fire report.

NWCG_REPORTING_UNIT_NAME = Active NWCG Unit Name for the unit preparing the fire report.

SOURCE_REPORTING_UNIT = Code for the agency unit preparing the fire report, based on code/name in the source dataset.
