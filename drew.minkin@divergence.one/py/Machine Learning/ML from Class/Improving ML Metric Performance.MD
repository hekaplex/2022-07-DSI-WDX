Things vary between ML modleing production runs
* Features
    * Adding new features
    * Normalization techniques
    * Manual binning
    * Transforms (log/exponent, etc.)
    * Ratios
* Sampling strategies
    * Balancing (binary classification)
    * Changing holdout (train/test) ratios
    * Changing seeds
    * Cross validation
* Modeling Strategies
    * Varying algorithm
    * Varying hyperparameter tuning of algorithm
        * grid search for ranges of value 
    * Composite modeling
        * Clustering to generate feature(s)
        * Ensemble techniques
            * Gradient boosted trees
            * Random forests
