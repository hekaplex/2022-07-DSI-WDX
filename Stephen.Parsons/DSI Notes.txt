SQL and POWER BI WILL GET YOU HIRED!!!

SQL= Structured Query Language
Datacamp is King 
Azure Data Studio for SQL heavy work
Pray for Kyiesha and her Mama

schema visualization.exe

Shame-free teaching
Can run Python in memory in SQL
SQL ON is dumb (fix it!) ???????????????????????????????????


full table names best practice
SHIFT+F1 looks up terms from querys
SARG (Searcg Argument)=Boolean
DataWarehouse is the cake. PowerBI , domo, cliq, etc is icing.

Friends don't let friends build virtual bots inside Microsoft
Chat bots arew only really useful for connecting to html sites (like a faq site) They will train on one quickly.
ALSO: PowerApps is great for collecting first-person data


Rachael Ridenour: The tools connect the points that already exist.

Write 5 SELECT statements
Between all queries you must use these clauses at some point but not all in any queries necessarily
GROUP BY & HAVING
WHERE
JOIN ( at least one OUTER)
ORDER BY

******DATA WAREHOUSING REQs: =Data Engineer (Anal Eng, App DS, ML Engineer...)PowerBI gives you empathy for what da and ds need from 
you. SQL!!! Azure Data Factory, Synapse, Data Bricks(GET CERT or DP500 and SQL experience) Synapse and DataBricks for building schemas for dbs.
Understand what it takes to build a Data Warehouse,

Donald Farmer was program mgr at power bi got to pitch to bill gates (play axis boy)

In DAX: CALCULATE = ninja WHERE clause

Drill Thru deprecated on mobile, because of mobile 

Datamart in powerbi is cutting edge

***POWERBI Does not automatically refresh***

Data Engineer/Data Arch/ DBA/ Data Warehousing- specifically anal focused de job- needed skills for tabular data- skip ahead to module 8
DeepLearning is dealing with more files than tables

capstone: find data, cite it (Markdown as url), show work in Jupyter notebook.

SPARK made DataBricks huge - Azure Synapse is MS answer to DataBricks
PowerQuery legacy of Excel

What is *_NEW?

Separating kit code into three elemental columns may provide more granular analytics.

Kyiesha: At the end of the day, the connections enable the analysis.

Drew's suggestions 16AUG AM:

Check for similar column names in each table - GROUP BY name from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS on the tables with a HAVING count > 1. Check in a second query for a INNER JOIN to see if you get all the rows on both sides

Use dynamic SQL to look for similar data types and distinct counts of values and try the JOIN checks again

##############################################

###Removing N from tail numbers (from Chris Davis):
update Table_name
set column = (column_name),(number to keep)###

###SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA

###GROUP BY * = row level

QUICKEST WAY TO GET FIRED in Enterprise Environment:

Important!Two things to NEVER ask Power Query to Do
    
1. Do Slowly Changing Dimension processing on files
	
2. Look for newest version of a fact ( orderID, etc) on file

Pandas day - 
(for big data)
sklearn
power query
spark 


pandas is between power bi and sql
pandas uses a lot of memory- 2-3 x wahat was on disk- just a bunch of lists running in the background

bands,cuts,groups.buckets, bins= clustering
(good to prep for supervised learming)

silhouettes= how dense are our clusters?(help to decide cluster sizes to use)
find good model, use clustering algorithm(prelude to work)  to take automatic output (good feature QUICK)

IOS stores NOTES in SQLite db
Jupyter is a platform- you can dev (panel is shiny for python- like powerapps and jupyter notebooks had a baby)
