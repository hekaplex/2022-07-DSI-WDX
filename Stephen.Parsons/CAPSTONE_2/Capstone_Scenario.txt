Near shore captures of actual ship positions 

Satellite captures of actual ship positions 

Vessel information (ownership, etc.) 

Information on port arrivals and departures 

 

Business Scenario 

There are two big questions that machine learning can help address ultimately: 

 

Port traffic forecasting is valuable business information to allow companies to make decisions on where to send goods to ensure speedy delivery. 

Cargo will frequently be sold and bought several times in transit. In order to have a good understanding of the impact on ports, you will need to first understand where some ships are going and if they are changing courses 

 

Specific Questions 

How much do journeys vary between different journeyâ€™s start and end ports? 

Are there any environmental factors (temperature or wind) that may account for the difference in journeys? 

What are the trends of activity by vessel as average length of dwell or journeys on a weekly monthly or quarterly basis? 

Are there any specific areas at sea where vessels seem to change direction on a journey?  What is the appropriate resolution to describe these regions of journey inflection? 

What are the trends of port activity ( number of ships incoming vs outgoing)on a weekly monthly or quarterly basis?
